# -Loan-Approval-project-using-machine-learing
A machine learning project for predicting loan approval decisions using multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors .
🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a loan application will be Approved or Rejected using Machine Learning classification algorithms.
We implemented and compared three popular ML algorithms:
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	•	Naive Bayes

The goal is to build a model that helps financial institutions automate and improve the loan approval decision process based on applicant details.

📌 Problem Statement

Banks receive thousands of loan applications daily. Manually verifying each application is time-consuming and prone to errors.
This project uses ML models to predict loan approval based on applicant data such as income, education, credit history, and other features.
